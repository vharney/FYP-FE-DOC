# ManageWearables.js

This page shows a list of wearables that can be connected to the application, and the user can only connect to one wearable. Currently, only Fitbit can be connected to the application, so there is only one option button on this page. Upon pressing the button, the user will be redirected to the **[Confirm page](./confirm-auth)**.
